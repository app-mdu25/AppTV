# IPTV TV Starter (Android Studio)

This is a minimal starter project for an Android TV IPTV app with Media3/ExoPlayer integration.
It includes a small sample player view and an M3U parser.

IMPORTANT:
- This template is a starter skeleton. You should update dependency versions to match your Android Studio.
- Replace sample stream URLs with your real streams and DRM license information (Widevine / ClearKey).
- Securely store license tokens (EncryptedSharedPreferences or backend token exchange).

How to use:
1. Open this folder in Android Studio.
2. Let Gradle sync. You may need to update plugin/Gradle wrapper versions.
3. Run on an Android TV device or emulator (with Google Play / Android TV image).
